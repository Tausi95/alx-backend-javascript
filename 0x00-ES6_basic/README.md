## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tausi95/alx-backend-javascript.git
cd alx-backend-javascript
npm install
```

## Usage

You can run the tasks using the following npm scripts:

```bash
npm run dev5 # To run the spread operator task
npm run dev6 # To run the string interpolation task
```

## Tasks

### 0. Constants

This task introduces constants in JavaScript. The concept of constants is crucial for defining immutable variables that should not be reassigned.

### 1. Spread Operator

The spread operator allows for the expansion of iterable objects into individual elements. It is used in this task to concatenate arrays effectively.

- **File**: `5-main.js`
- **Usage**: The script imports the `concatArrays` function from `5-spread-operator.js` and demonstrates its use.

### 2. String Interpolation

String interpolation allows for embedding expressions within string literals, improving the readability of string construction.

- **File**: `6-main.js`

### 3. Other Tasks

In addition to the above tasks, further tasks are implemented to enhance your understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities and features. Each task builds upon the previous ones, reinforcing the learning experience.
